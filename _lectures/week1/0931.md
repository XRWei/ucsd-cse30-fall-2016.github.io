# Week 1 Discussion 

This week we would be covering Source Code Management using git so that you can start working on your labs. If you are comfortable with git, feel free to skip. 
 
Here are a few things you can do to prepare for discussion -

1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on your laptop before coming to the session.

2. Browse through [git cheatsheet](http://www.cheat-sheets.org/saved-copy/git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
