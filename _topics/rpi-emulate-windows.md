## Emulating the Raspberry Pi with docker on Windows

Step 1: Install [virtual box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). If you have VMWare, that works too.

Step 2: Download [ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) and set up a ubuntu VM.

Step 3: Follow the instructions on [emulating the raspberry pi on linux](/topics/rpi-emulate-mac-linux/) from within your ubuntu VM

If you find that the performance of this setup unacceptable, consider running a ubuntu VM in the cloud. Instructions on this will follow shortly.
