# Course Policies

## Academic Integrity

Each student is responsible for knowing and abiding by UCSD's policies on Integrity of Scholarship and the Jacobs School Student Honor Code. Any student violating UCSD's Academic Dishonesty or UCSD's Student Conduct policies will earn an 'F' in the course and will be reported to their college Dean for administrative processing. Committing acts that violate Student Conduct policies that result in course disruption are cause for suspension or dismissal from UCSD.

## Collaboration

Students are encouraged to talk to each other, to the course staff, or to anyone else about any of the assignments. Assistance must be limited to discussion of the problem and sketching general approaches to a solution. Each student must write out his or her own solutions to written component of homeworks, programming assignments may be completed with a partner. Read the next section for more details on programming assignments .

## Policies related to homeworks and programming assignments

* All written homeworks must be done individually.

* Regrade requests for written homeworks should be submitted via gradescope.

* Programming assignments may be done in pairs and must be completed following a true pair programming style. You may choose a partner from any of the two sections of the class, but you cannot change partners during the course. If the partnership does not work out, you will need to complete the subsequent assignments individually.

* No extensions will be given on assignments except in very rare cases involving severe medical illness or other unavoidable emergencies.

* Code that does not compile will receive ZERO points. Make sure your code compiles before turning it in.

* Regrades for programming assignments should be requested by filling the regrade request form (Check Piazza for the link to the form and detailed instructions). 

* All regrade requests should be made no later than three days after grades are released.

## OSD Accommodations

UCSD provides accommodations to students with disabilities and special needs. If you are a OSD student, please contact me at the earliest to make necessary arrangements for exams

## Late Policy

Assignments will NOT be accepted after the due date: no exceptions! Makeup exams may be granted in case of medical emergencies. Please approach the instructor only if you are able to obtain a physician's note that is appropriately dated and has the contact of your doctor.

# Grading

Your final grade for the course will be based on the following components:

* 2% Class Participation
* 15%  Homeworks
* 28% Programming Assignments
* 15% Midterm 1
* 15% Midterm 2
* 25% Final exam

You may miss up to two classes without penalty (lowest two participation scores) will be dropped.


Grading will be based on the standard scale. To pass you must additionally score at least 50% in the programming assignments and appear for the final.


# Required and Recommended Resources

## Required textbooks

* Digital Design and Computer Architecture: ARM Edition, by Sarah Harris and David Harris. Free e-copy available through UCSD library [link to e-book](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780128000564). The book can only be accessed on the UCSD network/VPN.

* C Programming: A Modern Approach, 2nd Edition by K. N. King. Available for rent or purchase on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0393979504/ref=dp_olp_all_mbc?ie=UTF8&condition=all)

## Recommended textbooks

* Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, by Randal E. Bryant and David R. O'Hallaron

* Learn C the Hard Way: Practical Exercises on the Computational Subjects You Keep Avoiding (Like C) (Zed Shaw's Hard Way Series)

* Expert C Programming Deep C Secrets, by Peter van der Linden 

## Peer Instruction : iClickers (required)

The course lectures will follow a Peer Instruction format, a teaching model which places stronger emphasis on classroom discussion and student interaction. As part of this you will need to own an iClicker register it on the [iclicker website](https://www1.iclicker.com/register-clicker/). Be sure to register your clicker by the end of the first week.

You can use the same iclicker for multiple courses. The iClicker can be purchased at the UCSD book store.

You will be expected to have completed the assigned reading and ready to discuss with your classmates.

## Raspberry Pi hardware (recommended)
The programming assignments for the course involve writing ARM assembly code. 
If you are interested in working on the actual hardware, I recommend purchasing a Raspberry Pi. The Pi is a nifty little ARM-based computer, fun to program and great for doing embedded projects. Any of the following raspberry Pi models would work for our purpose: RPi 1 model B+, RPi 2 model B or RPi 3. Unless you already own a raspberry Pi, the [Raspberry Pi 3 kit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01C6Q2GSY?psc=1)  will probably give you the best return on investment.


If you do not wish to purchase the hardware, you may take a software only route. We will use docker and an ARM emulator to virtulaize the raspberry pi in software.
