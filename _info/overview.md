## Peer Instruction : iClickers

The course lectures will follow a Peer Instruction format, a teaching model which places stronger emphasis on classroom discussion and student interaction. As part of this you will need to own an iClicker register it on the [iclicker website](https://www1.iclicker.com/register-clicker/). Be sure to register your clicker by the end of the first week.

You can use the same iclicker for multiple courses. The iClicker can be purchased at the UCSD book store.

You will be expected to have completed the assigned reading and ready to discuss with your classmates.
